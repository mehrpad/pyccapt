# OXCART ATom Prob 
Oxcart is a self-construction and self-made atom probe. 
The special feature of this device is that it has a measuring chamber made of titanium in order to generate a particularly low-hydrogen vacuum.
The Oxcart is equipped with a highly efficient detector (approx. 85% detection efficiency)

This repository contains the GUI and program which control, visualize, and do the atom prob experiment.

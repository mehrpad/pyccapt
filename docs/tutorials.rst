Introduction to the tutorials for APT data calibration
============================================================

In the tutorials, we see how we can calibrate the data with PyCCAPT. The data processing
tutorial is a simple user friendly guide to crop, calibrate, 3d reconstruct, range, and visualize the data.
This tutorial is a good starting point for new users which use widgets to make it easy to process the data.
If you need more control over the data processing, you can use the other tutorials which are more advanced.
